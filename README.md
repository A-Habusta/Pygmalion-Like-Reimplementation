# Pygmalion-Like Reimplementation

This is my bachelors thesis program. The aim of the thesis is to recreate an example use case from a historical programming system called Pygmalion. The specific use case that the recreation is based on is the creation of an icon capable of computing the factorial of an integer.


The text of the thesis (which also contains a quick how-to in the appendix) is available here:
