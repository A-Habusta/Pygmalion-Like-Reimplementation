# Pygmalion-Like Reimplementation

This is my bachelors thesis program. The aim is to create a not-so-faithful recreation of the Pygmalion system, which was a pioneer in the field of icon programming.
This is the first version of the program, and it is not complete, due to us moving on to another design. This design is included only for the sake of comparison with the second one.
